# RC-car-project-for-mapping

This is my thesis project for the department of Computers Engineering of the Technological Educational 
Institute of Athens (TEI A). 

It's a remote control vehicle that features livestreaming cam view and the update of a graph according to it's 
movements in a space. 

It combines Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi and the Processing software. :)
